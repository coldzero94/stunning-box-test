year. This is mainly attributed to the rising demand for livestock products in developing countries. While 
high-income countries have shown a steady and consistent rise, the rising populations of emerging and 
developing markets have supported similar and explosive growth. Africa’s demand for livestock-derived 
foods is projected to increase by a remarkable 80% in just two decades (from 2010 to 2030), mostly due 
to its increasing population. In addition, the demand for livestock food products is expected to increase 
from 200 kcal per person per day in 2000 to around 400 kcal per person per day by 2050 in sub-Saharan 
Africa and South Asia. Since diseases caused by endoparasites may prove fatal to animals resulting in 
lower production of meat and milk, there is a need to prevent the spread and infection caused by 
endoparasites among food-producing animals. This, coupled with the growing demand for animal protein 
across the world, is expected to drive the growth of the parasiticides market in the coming years."

three of every four new or emerging infectious diseases in humans come from animals. Animal parasites 
responsible for the animal-to-human transfer of diseases include tapeworms, protozoa, trematodes or 
flukes, nematodes (roundworms), ticks, mites, and fleas. As an example, rickettsia rickettsii causes Rocky 
Mountain spotted fever and spreads to animals and humans through ticks. In addition, 
cysticercosis/taeniasis (a disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Taenia), which infects swine, results 
in headaches and seizures in human beings. Close contact with companion animals and rapid 
socioeconomic changes in the food production system have increased the number of zoonotic diseases. 
Companion animals are increasingly treated as family members, and pets have many zoonotic diseases 
that may infect their owners. Similarly, foodborne zoonoses have become an important public health 
concern worldwide; every year, a large number of people are affected by diseases due to the consumption 
of contaminated animal-origin food."

emerging infectious diseases that are reported globally are zoonoses. Over 30 new human pathogens have 
been detected in the last three decades, 75% of which have originated in animals. In addition, according to 
the European Food Safety Authority, over 350,000 human cases of food-borne zoonotic diseases are 
reported each year in the European Union. The growing incidence of zoonotic diseases has correspondingly 
strengthened the demand to prevent the spread of these causal parasites from animals to humans; this is 
driving the greater uptake of parasiticides among the animals across the world."

farmers and pet owners tend to increase the dosage or change the parasiticides used. However, this may 
prove detrimental in the long run and result in multi-drug-resistant parasite species. Over the years, ticks 
have become increasingly resistant to acaricides. Many researchers state that the severity of tick 
resistance has reached a level where resistance must be expected in ticks within five to ten years of the 
introduction of any new type of acaricide. Amitraz and pyrethroids are the cheapest acaricides available in

identification of the species is followed by the development of a new drug for treating ailments caused by 
the same; this is a time-consuming process. Sometimes, it may happen that an animal is administered with 
an endoparasiticide that differs from the one designed for the diagnosed causative endoparasite. In such 
cases, the causative agent may develop immunity against the endoparasiticide. Therefore, manufacturers 
of parasiticides have to conduct different tests on animals to prove the efficiency of the drug developed. 
This is a time-consuming and expensive task, which may lead to the disapproval of new drugs developed 
as parasiticides."

implemented in most regions. They have left most major players functioning at negligible capacity, or even 
immobilized them completely. Major players in the market have adopted several measures to deal with the 
current market scenario. For instance, in May 2020, Zoetis announced that it would lower its financial 
guidance through annual reports to reflect its current situation due to the estimated impact of the COVID-
19 outbreak. In addition, in May 2020, Elanco Animal Health reported a 10% decrease in total revenue 
during the first quarter of 2020, as compared with its 2019 first-quarter performance (USD 731.1 in 2019 
million to USD 657.7 million in 2020), this decrease is driven largely by the global impact of the novel 
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In April 2020, Merck & Co. announced the lowering of its 2020 revenue 
expectations by about USD 2.5 billion in anticipation of the negative impact on its vaccines, cancer drugs, 
and animal health products. Reduction in parasiticide manufacturing capacity and output will lead to 
product unavailability and hampered supply chains, leading to a negative impact on market growth during 
2020–2021."

Horses are susceptible to more than 60 internal parasites and may shelter several species of worms that 
serve as a source of infection for other horses. Horses are affected by several species of intestinal worm 
parasites, lungworms, skin parasites, and bots, which can cause a range of health problems including 
colic, diarrhea, anemia, ill thrift, stunting of growth in young animals, poor coat, and poor performance. The 
effects of internal parasites are more evident in young and undernourished horses."

horse population witnessed a decline of about 1 million per year between 2014 and 2018. However,

Scandinavian, and African countries. As per FAOSTAT, in the US, the total number of horses increased to 
10.4 million in 2018 from 10.2 million in 2015. The growing need for efficient pasture management; focus 
on decreasing the parasite burden in these countries; and the need for the therapeutic deworming of 
horses with the use of appropriate products at proper intervals are some major factors are driving the 
growth of the parasiticides market for horses."

the human food chain. Moreover, they also form a source of income for farmers and livestock producers. 
Cattle are more susceptible to parasitic infestations and diseases due to internal parasites, which can 
result in significant production losses. Parasitic diseases are caused by internal helminths such as 
roundworms, tapeworms, and flukes, as well as external arthropods such as mites, lice, ticks, and flies. 
Fluke-free cattle gain an additional 0.2 pounds/day in the feedlot as compared to cattle that have been 
infected by flukes. Therefore, the prevention and control of various internal and external parasites and 
treatment of parasitic diseases in cattle is vital."

meat globally, following pork, poultry, and beef. Thus, the prevention and control of parasites in sheep and 
goats become imperative to maintain healthy livestock. The growing reliability of dewormers or 
anthelmintic drugs for preventing internal parasite infestations in sheep and goats is a major factor driving 
the growth of this market segment."

this meat with the diverse immigrant ethnic groups and growing culinary interest in authentic ethnic foods 
and the health benefits of lean red meat. China, India, and Nigeria also stand among the largest producers 
and consumers of sheep and goat meat."

demand for parasiticides in the US is mainly driven by the rise in pet adoption, the availability of pet health 
insurance, rising demand for animal-derived food products, and rising awareness about zoonotic diseases. 
According to the US CDC, there is a growing threat of exposure of companion animals to diseases caused 
by ticks and other ectoparasites. Climatic changes and increasing exposure of wildlife to suburban 
environments have boosted the incidence of diseases such as Lyme disease and thereby stimulated the 
consumption of animal parasiticides."

survey, from USD 69.51 billion in 2017 to USD 75.38 billion in 2019."

more than 289 million pets (289,359,000) in 2018—103 million cats, 85 million dogs, 15.4 million fish, 
50 million caged birds, and 27 million small mammals. Approximately 80 million homes in Europe had

beef increased significantly, due to which the production of livestock increased by around 4–6% in the

derived products globally. According to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) 2019, 
2.7 million tons of pork were exported from Europe in the same year, as opposed to 2.1 million tons in 
2018. Owing to this, companies are increasingly investing in animal healthcare to provide the necessary

has been accompanied by an increasing focus on animal health. This, coupled with the rising healthcare 
expenditure in the country, is supporting the growth of the veterinary market in Germany. The country has 
also registered the highest per capita animal health expenditure in Europe, with around 87% of dog owners 
and 70% of cat owners regularly visiting veterinarians for pet health checkups. According to a study 
conducted by the University of Gottingen, German pet owners spent USD 2.75 billion on animal healthcare 
in 2016. This has led to an increase in the demand for pet insurance; around 33% of pet owners in 
Germany used pet insurance in 2018."

driving factors for the market in the country are the growing pet adoption, rising animal health expenditure, 
the availability of animal health insurance, and awareness about zoonotic diseases."
"물 입양 증가, 동물보건 지출 상승, 동물 건강보험의 이용가능성, 인수공통감염병에 대한 인식 개선 등이 있다.","The UK has a well-established animal health sector. However, the animal health diagnostics market in the 
UK is currently in the growth phase. Pet ownership in the UK has witnessed a stable increase over the 
years, with ~50% of households in the region having at least one pet. This makes the UK a relatively large 
market for animal healthcare products. In 2017, ~44% of households owned a companion animal, making 
the UK a relatively large market for animal healthcare products (Source: Pet Food Manufacturers 
Association). According to the FEDIAF, the UK had the highest population of dogs in Europe—25% of 
households owned a dog, as opposed to 17% that owned a cat in 2018. The population of dogs in the UK 
increased from 8.5 million in 2017 to 9 million in 2019. Moreover, in the UK, private insurance available 
for pets covers the cost of veterinary fees to treat injuries and diseases. This has increased the preference 
for pet insurance and boosted animal healthcare expenditure."
"영국의 동물보건 부문은 안정화되었지만, 영국의 동물 대상 건강진단 시장은 현재 성장기에 있다. 영국의 반려동","Demand in the companion animal sector is paralleled by rising production volumes in the livestock 
industry. For that matter, according to the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board of the UK, beef 
and veal production increased from 846.7 thousand tons in 2013 to 901.6 thousand tons in 2017. 
According to the National Beef Association, the UK produced 6.7 million tons of beef in 2019. Similarly, in 
2018, poultry meat production increased to 140.6 thousand tons from 130.5 thousand tons in 2014."

of the market in the UK. The UK DEFRA laid down various rules and regulations for the maintenance of 
animal and consumer health for the prevention of animal diseases. These guidelines promote the use of 
diagnostic products for the diagnosis and monitoring of animal diseases, and thereby maintain animal as 
well as public health. The number of veterinary practices has also increased— from 20,000 in 2016 to 
25,000 in 2019. The growing number of practicing veterinarians is expected to boost the growth of the

attractiveness of France with regard to the animal health sector lies in the density of its industrial and 
veterinary fields, its recognized scientific and technical expertise, and the capacity of manufacturers to 
invest in R&D. France accounted for 18.3% of the European market in 2019. This market is mainly driven 
by factors such as the growing companion animal population, an increase in animal healthcare 
expenditure, and the rising number of veterinary professionals in France. The presence of various major 
players operating in the animal parasiticides market space in the country is further aiding the market 
growth."

products. The population of companion animals in the country has witnessed a significant increase, driven 
mainly by increasing investments in pet healthcare. According to the FEDIAF, 21% of households in France 
owned a dog, and 24% owned a cat. In addition, the willingness to spend on pet health is a key driver for 
the growth of the companion animal health industry in France, which, in turn, is driving the market for 
animal health and diagnostics. Pet owners in France were relatively less concerned about the effects of the 
economic downturn on their companion animal health spending, which has helped sustain growth in the 
animal health market even during times of economic uncertainty (Source: FEDIAF)."

forecast period. Spain is one of the fastest-growing animal health markets in Europe. Although the country 
has witnessed marginal growth in its companion animal population, the number of veterinary practices and 
the willingness to spend on animal healthcare have both risen. According to the FEDIAF in 2018, the 
canine population in the country increased from 4.72 million to 6.27 million from 2010 to 2018."

Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Environment (MAGRAMA), in 2019, total pork production recorded an 
increase of 3.4% over the previous year. In addition, according to the French Institute of Pig and Pork, an 
increase of 21% in pork export was observed in Spain in 2019, as compared to 2018. The increase in pork

livestock producers, thus contributing directly to market growth in the country."

to reach USD 485.3 million by 2025 from USD 330.0 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 8.0% during the 
forecast period. The major factors driving the growth of the market in Italy include the rising population of 
cats, cattle, and swine; growing demand for poultry and pork meat; and rising awareness about pet 
healthcare. Italy has a rich diversity of animal breeds and livestock. Modern animal production systems in 
Italy are highly intensified and standardized; highly productive breeds from Italy have been distributed 
globally and are preferred over local breeds in many countries."

the country. Factors such as increased pet adoption, along with the better availability of pet products 
through large-scale outlets, are supporting market growth in the country. According to the US Department 
of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) report, Italy had a pet population of 60 million in 2016. 
The pet products market in Italy grew by 4% in 2015, reaching sales of USD 686 million (EUR 617 million); 
it is further estimated to grow by 7–8% by 2020. The pet insurance sector in the country is currently very 
small, but evolving rapidly; ~27% of the pet population in Italy has insurance coverage."

pork meat has increased steadily in the country, which has led to a growing need to maintain the health 
and well-being of the livestock population. However, per capita pig meat consumption in Italy has 
decreased from 39.1 kg per head in 2015 to 38.3 kg per head in 2016 due to a decrease in the available 
grazing areas and an outbreak of FMD in the region."

bovine rhinotracheitis) are the most common health disorders. The high prevalence of these diseases and 
the need to maintain the health of the livestock has generated a high demand for monitoring and 
diagnostic products in this region. During 2016–2017, the population of buffaloes, goats, and sheep 
declined due to receding grazing areas and an outbreak of tick-borne diseases in the region. This affected 
the sales of veterinary pharmaceuticals, including parasiticidal drugs, in the country."

population and willingness to spend on animal health, is expected to propel the growth of this market in 
the country. The major players in the animal parasiticides market in Italy include Zoetis, Inc. (US), Eli Lilly

"아시아 태평양은 2019년 동물용 구충제 시장의 15.8%를 차지했다. 이 지역 부문은 2020년 15억 6,160만 달러","In 2019, the Asia Pacific accounted for a share of 15.8% of the animal parasiticides market. This regional 
segment is projected to reach USD 2,320.0 million by 2025 from USD 1,561.6 million in 2020. APAC 
countries, especially India and China, represent the highest growth potential for animal parasiticides. The 
APAC market is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 8.2% during the forecast period of 2019–2025. 
This can primarily be attributed to the large domesticated animal population in the region. In the past few 
years, the market in the Asia Pacific has witnessed significant changes owing to factors such as growth in 
pet adoption, increasing awareness about animal health, and growing per capita animal health 
expenditure, especially in India and China. In 2019, China held the largest share of 37.0% of the APAC 
market, followed by Australia, Japan, and India, with shares of 26.6%, 13.9%, and 10.4%, respectively."

based products, such as meat and milk, is increasing in emerging APAC markets. In this scenario, ensuring 
the health of animals and maintaining their productivity gains added importance. This has created a 
demand for animal parasiticides in the APAC. The Chinese and Indian markets have witnessed stable 
growth, owing to increasing awareness about animal diseases and the rising number of veterinary 
professionals and clinics. In China, livestock production has increased at a faster pace as compared to 
other agricultural sub-sectors, owing to substantial growth in its porcine and poultry industries."

30.7% cat owners, and 27.3% aquatic animal owners. With the growing pet adoption, the expenditure on

countries. According to the US Meat Export Federation, China ranks first in the world for pork consumption. 
The consumption of pork increased from 28.3 kg per person in 2012 to 34.2 kg per person in 2019. 
Moreover, according to the FAO, total pork consumption in China was 40,698.6 metric tons in 2000; this 
figure is estimated to increase to 62,748.6 metric tons by 2030. The increase in pork & beef consumption

head, down from the 8.25 million estimated for 2018. This is due to the country’s dry and hot weather, 
which has resulted in poor pasture growth, high grain prices, and low water storages over much of eastern 
Australia."

dogs being the most common (40%), followed by cats (27%). The growing pet population demands the pet

projected to reach USD 312.2 million by 2025 from USD 213.7 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 7.9% during 
the forecast period. Changing social and environmental factors have increased the number and breeds of 
animals imported into Japan in the past few years, which, alongside the growing companion animal 
industry, has resulted in an increased risk of zoonotic diseases."
업의 성장과 더불어 인수공통감염병의 리스크가 증가하였다.,"The country has registered a rise in the adoption of companion animals, especially smaller breeds. This 
has driven the growth of the country’s animal healthcare expenditure. In addition, a growing number of pet 
owners in the country are opting for pet insurance, which costs ~USD 20–25 (JPY 2,000) per month. The 
majority of Japanese pet owners spend more on the health and well-being of their pets as compared to 
counterparts in developed countries across North America and Europe."
"반려동물, 특히 소동물 품종의 입양의 증가세가 나타났다. 이러한 추세는 일본에서는 동물보건 지출의 성장을 주","With rising pet care expenditure, the pet insurance industry has also witnessed a surge. According to a 
private survey, the pet insurance market that covers cats and dogs has seen an annual growth of 20% to 
reach USD 450 million (YEN 49 billion) in 2018. Moreover, Japan has also witnessed an increase in the 
number of small and large animal veterinary clinics as well as the overall number of veterinarians. 
Companies are also investing in this market—for instance, Mars, Inc. entered the veterinary clinics market 
in Japan in 2019 by adding veterinary properties and services in the country. However, even though the 
number of veterinarians is increasing, a shortfall of skilled practitioners deters optimal market growth."
"도하였다. 뿐만 아니라 더 많은 반려동물 소유자가 반려동물 보험을 이용하며 매달 20-25달러(약 2,000엔)의 비","According to the FAO, the import of animal-derived products in Japan is expected to rise to fulfill the 
increasing demand for these products. The growing livestock industry in Japan and the high density of 
imported animals have raised the risk of zoonotic diseases and prompted the Japanese government to 
implement measures for the domestic and border control of these diseases, using initiatives like the Japan 
Animal Referral Medical Center (JARMeC) for animal healthcare to provide an environment for advanced 
veterinary education, clinical research, and advanced medical services. This also aims to reduce the 
burden of Japan’s shortage of vets."

changing lifestyles have had favorable impacts on the Indian pet health market. According to the India 
International Pet Trade Fair (IIPTF), the pet dog population increased from 19.41 million in 2018 to 21.42

market in India is growing at 13.9% annually; it is estimated to reach USD 430 million by 2020. 
Euromonitor International has projected India to be the fastest-growing pets market. Rising pet ownership 
rates are driving demand for health products, and, subsequently, that for veterinary products. However, 
awareness of pet care and animal diseases is still very low in the country, equating to a high pet death 
rate. Despite significant growth in the animal health industry in India, the penetration of pet insurance is 
still very low."

essential part of the agricultural sector in India and play a major role in revenue and employment 
generation and in developing a sustainable agricultural system. The demand for animal-derived food 
products, such as milk and meat, has increased in India, which has greatly supported the demand for 
veterinary care and health-related products in the market. According to the Department of Animal 
Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD), the livestock population in India has grown by 4.6% from 512 million in 
2012 to about 536 million in 2019. The population of cows showed an impressive increase of 18%; the 
consumption of animal-derived food products such as milk and meat has also increased in the past few 
years, which serves as a major growth factor for the animal parasiticides market."

strengthened existing veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. In addition, the National Research Centre on 
Equines conducts various research programs, such as Surveillance, Monitoring, and Control of Emerging

products are important considerations in this market segment."
부문에서 신중하게 고려되고 있다.,"South Korea, Australia, and Singapore are among the fastest-growing veterinary markets in the APAC, 
mainly due to rising pet ownership rates and growing awareness of animal health. According to the 
Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), the pet population in Australia was 24 million in 2017. At 62%, 
Australia has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the world. The majority of pet owners in Australia 
spent around USD 12.2 billion on pet healthcare products and services in 2017, which indicates an 
increase of over 42% in pet healthcare expenditure from 2013. Of this, more than a third is on food (USD 
4.2 billion), followed by veterinary services (USD 2.2 billion) and other healthcare or general pet products. 
In 2016, the expenditure on canine and feline care was USD 7 billion and USD 4 billion, respectively."

market is primarily driven by the increasing population of companion and food-producing animals and the 
rising demand for animal-derived food products in this region. Latin American countries considered for this 
study are Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, among others."
물의 개체수 증가와 동물성 식품에 대한 수요 증가에 주로 기인한다. 이 분석의 대상이 된 라틴 아메리카 국가는,"Pet adoption in Latin American countries has significantly risen from 2009 to 2016. Currently, Brazil has 
the world’s third-largest dog and cat population, with over 37.1 million dogs and 21.3 million cats. The 
growing pet adoption has increased the demand for related healthcare services, thereby supporting the 
uptake of routine disease testing services. Latin America witnessed a 44% increase in its pet health 
expenditure in the past five years. However, though the number of pet animals is high in Latin America—
specifically Brazil—there is a need for a well-organized pet insurance structure in this region."
"브라질, 멕시코, 아르헨티나이다.","According to the UN FAO and the OECD, the demand for animal-based proteins is expected to rise in the 
region. While the consumption of beef, pig, and veal meat is expected to grow by 10% by 2028, the 
demand for poultry and fish meat is expected to increase by 15% and 12% during the same period. Poultry 
consumption is expected to account for 42.1% of total meat consumption in the region by 2028, at 34.2 kg 
consumption per capita per year."

currently, Brazil is one of the fastest-growing pet care markets. According to ABINPET, the Brazilian

increasing awareness on and attention to healthcare among pet animal owners. In addition, the rising 
incidences of infections from ectoparasites such as ticks and mites, as well as endoparasites like protozoa 
and nematodes in companion animals are propelling the need for parasite control in these animals. The 
growing consumption of meat and milk in Brazil is a major driver for this market as most food-producing 
animals are susceptible to parasitic diseases. For instance, meat production in Brazil increased from 
27.69 million tons in 2017 to 29.34 million tons in 2018."

production in the region in 2018. Despite increasing production levels, parasitic diseases still impact the 
productivity of livestock animals in the region. Hence, the need to control these diseases forms a key driver

boost the demand for pet healthcare and thereby contribute to market growth."
