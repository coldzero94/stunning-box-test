EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The global animal parasiticides market is projected to reach USD 13.7 billion in 2025 from USD 9.7 billion 
in 2020, at a CAGR of 7.2% during the forecast period. Factors such as the rising demand for animal food 
products, increasing investments, growing concerns over zoonotic diseases, worldwide regulations for the 
prevention of the spread of diseases, growth in the companion animal market, and increasing veterinary 
healthcare expenditure are the major factors driving the growth of this market. However, the shift towards 
vegetarian diets and the restrictions on the use of parasiticides in food-producing animals are hindering 
the market growth.  
In this report, the animal parasiticides market is segmented on the basis of type, animal type, end user, 
and region.

Based on type, the animal parasiticides market is segmented into endoparasiticides, ectoparasiticides, 
and endectocides. The ectoparasiticides accounted for the largest share of 64% of the market. This 
segment is projected to reach USD 9,621 million by 2025 from USD 6,302.6 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 
8.8%. The large share of this segment can primarily be attributed to the large popularity of 
ectoparasiticides and the growing number of parasitic infections due to external parasites.
